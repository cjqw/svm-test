* svm-test
This is my homework using libsvm in a k-class classification problem.
I tried 3 kinds of decomposing method to decompose the k-class problem
into several 2-class problem: one vs one, one vs rest and part vs part.

Grid search and cross validation are used to find the best parameters.

For more details, see my [[file:report.pdf][report]].
